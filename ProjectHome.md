<h1>Localendar</h1>
<i>A location-based calendar</i>

<hr />
Nowadays, we usually use time-based schedule. For sure, we can clearly know the time-ordering of events, yet, we have no idea about the location of those events. We also do not know anything regarding travel time or best path unless we switch to other map applications.<br>
<br>
The problem is we do not always remember to check it. Instead of forgetting the tasks, what happens more often is, we are late. This motivates us to build a to-do apps with recommend path or estimated arrival time. An alarm reminder based-on the estimated arrival time and current location would further secure Android user from being late. It could help people to manage their time easily and more relaxingly.<br>
<br>
Our COMP3111 group project is basically a location-based calendar. Apart from classical calendar features, it can also implement function closely related to location of event and users.<br>
